//! # Wallet Callback Handler
//! This CallbackHandler will monitor event streams from the various wallet services and on relevant events will call
//! the assigned callbacks to provide asynchronous feedback to the client application that an event has occured
//!
//! ## Callbacks  
//! `callback_received_transaction` - This will be called when an inbound transaction is received from an external
//! wallet
//!
//! `callback_received_transaction_reply` - This will be called when a reply is received for a pending outbound
//! transaction that is waiting to be negotiated
//!
//! `callback_received_finalized_transaction` - This will be called when a Finalized version on an Inbound transaction
//! is received from the Sender of a transaction
//!
//! `callback_transaction_broadcast` - This will be  called when a Finalized transaction is detected a Broadcast to a
//! base node mempool.
//!
//! `callback_transaction_mined` - This will be called when a Broadcast transaction is detected as mined via a base
//! node request
//!
//! `callback_discovery_process_complete` - This will be called when a `send_transacion(..)` call is made to a peer
//! whose address is not known and a discovery process must be conducted. The outcome of the discovery process is
//! relayed via this callback
//!
//! `callback_base_node_sync_complete` - This is called when a Base Node Sync process is completed or times out. The
//! request_key is used to identify which request this callback references and a result of true means it was successful
//! and false that the process timed out and new one will be started
